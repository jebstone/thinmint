Thinmint.io was a personal project exploring the feasibility of jump-starting a content site via purchased email lead lists. List quality was even lower than expected, cutting the project short after several hundred thousand sends.

Code here is the Python program for sending an HTML-templated email to users gathered from a database. It has no error-checking code because it never failed :)
